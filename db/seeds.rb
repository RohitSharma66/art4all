# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# puts "Cleaning up database"
# Art.destroy_all if Rails.env.development?
# User.destroy_all
# puts "Database is clean"

# puts "Arts is creating"

# 1.times do |i|

#   user = User.create(
#     email: Faker::Internet.email,
#     first_name: Faker::Name.first_name,
#     last_name: Faker::Name.last_name,
#     password: 'test123456'
